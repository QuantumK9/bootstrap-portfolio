# Bootstrap Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a challenge for the end of the third week of the Trilogy Front End Web Development Bootcamp. 

For this challenge, a responsive mobile-first website had to be created, using Bootstrap 4 framework. The purpose of this challenge is to create a Portfolio website while familiarizing with Bootstrap properties and also be able to customize certain parts of the framework so it looks less "Bootstrap-y". 

Again for this challenge, not much effort was put in the creation of the actual content (adding cv info, contact details, list of skills etc), but mostly on the structural and stylistic aspect of the page.

## Installation (optional)

If someone wants to, they can download the code from the following repository:
